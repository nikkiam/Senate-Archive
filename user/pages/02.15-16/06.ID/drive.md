# Internal Development
## Chair: Nikki Ambalo

The Internal Development Committee strives to improve the inner workings of the Undergraduate Student Senate by providing for the continual development and evolution of the Senate as a legislative institution, providing for the personal development of Senators, providing opportunities for Senators to engage one another both socially and for matters of official business, and helping improve the reputation of the body by working closely with Senators, constituents, and campus organizations.

Initiatives:
