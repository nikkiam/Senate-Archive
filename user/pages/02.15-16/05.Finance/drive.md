# Finance Committee
## Chair: Stephanie Emore

The Senate Finance Committee is responsible for allocating 10% of the Student Activities Fee in a way which best represents the interest of the Student Body. Every week student organizations will apply to Senate for Special Allocation Funding, and the Finance Committee will recommend to the general body an amount that they determine is in the best interest of both the organization and the student body.

Initiatives:
While not usually an initative driven committee, Finance is currently working on a funding web app that will allow students to find funding for any given project that they may want to pursue. Watch this space for funding.cmusenate.org!
